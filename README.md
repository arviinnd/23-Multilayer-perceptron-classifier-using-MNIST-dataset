Dear everyone, <br>
Good afternoon! <br>

Subject: use case on multilayer perceptron classifier using MNIST dataset.
<br>
<br>
Respected everyone, 
<br>
<br>
We have been given a use case on MNIST data. We load the dataset using keras library and print the dimensions of the data. We split the 
data into train and test data and create an mlp classifier using the sklearn library. The model gives an accuracy of 96 %. We then change 
the activation function, solver, learning rate and hidden layers to check the accuracy. We carry out validation on a set of hyperparameters.

<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
